# Manual Mapping Management - UI Only

## Overview
The Order Transformer application has been configured to use **manual mapping management only** through the UI. All automatic mapping loading scripts have been disabled to ensure complete control over mapping data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `init_database.py`
- **Before**: Automatically loaded mappings from Excel files in `mappings/` directory
- **After**: Only initializes database schema and runs migrations
- **Result**: No automatic mapping data loading on database initialization

### 2. Disabled Automatic Mapping Scripts
The following scripts have been renamed with `DISABLED_` prefix to prevent accidental execution:

- `DISABLED_migrate_kehe_mappings.py`
- `DISABLED_migrate_unfi_east_mappings.py` 
- `DISABLED_migrate_wholefoods_mappings.py`
- `DISABLED_import_mappings.py`
- `DISABLED_import_unfi_west_mappings.py`
- `DISABLED_render_import_kehe_mappings.py`
- `DISABLED_render_import_wholefoods_mappings.py`
- `DISABLED_deploy_kehe_mappings_to_render.py`
- `DISABLED_deploy_wholefoods_mappings_to_render.py`

### 3. UI-Only Mapping Management
All mapping operations are now handled exclusively through the Streamlit UI:

#### **Customer Mappings**
- ✅ Upload CSV files through UI
- ✅ Download current mappings through UI
- ✅ Delete mappings through UI
- ✅ Add new mappings through UI
- ✅ Bulk edit through UI
- ✅ Row-by-row edit through UI

#### **Store Mappings**
- ✅ Upload CSV files through UI
- ✅ Download current mappings through UI
- ✅ Delete mappings through UI
- ✅ Add new mappings through UI
- ✅ Bulk edit through UI
- ✅ Row-by-row edit through UI

#### **Item Mappings**
- ✅ Upload CSV files through UI
- ✅ Download current mappings through UI
- ✅ Delete mappings through UI
- ✅ Add new mappings through UI
- ✅ Bulk edit through UI
- ✅ Row-by-row edit through UI

## Benefits

### 1. Complete Control
- **No Automatic Loading**: No scripts will accidentally load mappings
- **Manual Management**: All mapping changes are intentional and controlled
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are made through the UI with clear feedback

### 2. Data Integrity
- **No Conflicts**: Prevents conflicts between automatic scripts and manual changes
- **Consistent State**: Database state is always managed through the UI
- **Clear Ownership**: All mapping data is explicitly managed by users

### 3. Production Safety
- **No Accidental Overwrites**: Scripts can't accidentally overwrite production data
- **Controlled Deployments**: Only UI changes affect the production database
- **Predictable Behavior**: Application behavior is consistent and predictable

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. **Database Initialization**: Run `init_database.py` only to create tables (no data loading)
2. **Mapping Management**: Use the Streamlit UI for all mapping operations
3. **No Scripts**: Do not run any of the `DISABLED_` scripts

### For Users
1. **Upload Mappings**: Use the "Upload Mapping" button in the UI
2. **Download Mappings**: Use the "Download Current" button to export mappings
3. **Edit Mappings**: Use "Bulk Editor" or "Row by Row" for modifications
4. **Delete Mappings**: Use the "Delete Mapping" interface with selection

## File Structure
```
OrderTransformer/
├── app.py                          # Main Streamlit application (UI only)
├── init_database.py                # Database schema initialization only
├── DISABLED_*.py                   # Disabled automatic mapping scripts
├── mappings/                       # CSV files (reference only, not auto-loaded)
└── database/                       # Database models and services
```

## Verification
To verify that no automatic loading occurs:

1. **Fresh Database**: Initialize a new database with `init_database.py`
2. **Check Tables**: Verify tables exist but are empty
3. **UI Operations**: Use only UI operations to manage mappings
4. **No Scripts**: Confirm no `DISABLED_` scripts are executed

## Support
All mapping management is now handled through the Streamlit UI. If you need to restore automatic loading functionality, the `DISABLED_` scripts can be renamed back (remove `DISABLED_` prefix) and the `init_database.py` file can be restored to its original state.
